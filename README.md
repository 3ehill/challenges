# Fizz Buzz
fizzBuzz.js is my solution to the Fizz Buzz Challenge by Codepen.io using JavaScript.
Prompt by Codepen: 
"Here's how the FizzBuzz challenge works: Starting at the number 1, you count upward to 100. For each number that is divisible by 3, you print the word "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, you print the word "Buzz". If it happens to be both (e.g. 15) you print "FizzBuzz". Otherwise you print the number itself."
